# 🛡️ API Sentinel – SOC Monitoring & Attack Detection Platform

API Sentinel is a **Security Operations Center (SOC)–focused API monitoring and attack detection system** designed to identify and visualize malicious API traffic in real time.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Modern applications rely heavily on APIs, making them a critical attack surface.  
API Sentinel provides **real-time detection, logging, and visualization** of suspicious and malicious API behavior.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **API Traffic Input**
   - Receives structured JSON payloads simulating real API requests.

2. **Detection Engine**
   - Analyzes request volume, payload size, response codes, and timing.
   - Classifies traffic as normal or malicious.

3. **Severity Classification**
   - Attacks are labeled as **Low / Medium / Critical**.

4. **SOC Logging**
   - Logs include timestamp, source IP, username, attack status, and confidence score.

5. **SOC Dashboard**
   - Built with Streamlit for real-time visualization and analysis.
